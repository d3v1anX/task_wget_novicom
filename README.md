## Information about this repository 

I forked the repo from https://github.com/KevinTrevor/task_wget_novicom to have a few more options to deploy on live server.

Lets work here further (but @Kevin, please don't remove your repository, otherwise this would be invalid as well).

Me or Daniel (@dooboy) will give you more "issues" (some changes on stylings, maybe images, maybe texts) on this repository this week. :-)

# this is just a test for testing live deployment
